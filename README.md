# Airbnb-Data-Analytics
This project explores Airbnb listing data to uncover trends in pricing, availability, neighborhood popularity, and room types. Using data visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium, the analysis reveals key insights such as which areas are most in demand, how prices vary by location and room type .
🧾 Project Title:
“Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization of Airbnb Listings”
📌 1. Project Objective
The goal of this project is to understand the Airbnb ecosystem in a specific city or globally through detailed data analysis and visualizations. It aims to:

Identify popular neighborhoods

Analyze price trends

Understand host behavior

Explore room type availability

Detect outliers or unusual patterns

📁 2. Dataset Overview
The dataset usually includes information such as:

Listing ID & Name

Host Information

Neighbourhood & Location (Latitude/Longitude)

Room Type (Entire home/apt, Private room, Shared room)

Price

Minimum Nights

Number of Reviews

Availability (days per year)

You can download datasets from:

Inside Airbnb

Kaggle

Example dataset: Airbnb NYC 2023

🧹 3. Data Preprocessing
Before analysis, the data must be cleaned:

Remove missing or duplicate records (like listings without names or host IDs)

Handle extreme values or outliers (e.g., listings priced at $10,000+ per night)

Drop irrelevant columns (e.g., URLs, unnecessary IDs)

Convert location values (latitude/longitude) to usable format for maps

This step ensures accuracy in the visualizations and insights.

📊 4. Data Analysis & Visualization
Now the cleaned data is ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

📍 A. Neighborhood Analysis
Visualize number of listings per neighborhood group (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn).

Analyze which neighborhoods have higher average prices.

Use heatmaps or bar charts to compare listing densities.

Insight Example:

“Manhattan has the most listings, but Brooklyn has more budget-friendly options.”

💵 B. Price Distribution
Use histograms or box plots to examine how prices are distributed.

Identify median and average prices.

Explore price outliers — extremely expensive listings.

Insight Example:

“Most listings fall under $200, but a few luxury listings drive up the average.”

🛏 C. Room Type Analysis
Visualize the distribution of room types (Entire home, Private room, Shared room).

Compare average prices by room type.

Understand which room types are most common in which neighborhoods.

Insight Example:

“Private rooms are most common, but entire homes command the highest prices.”

📆 D. Availability & Booking Trends
Analyze availability_365 column to see how often listings are available.

Group listings by availability ranges (e.g., 0-100, 100-200 days).

Spot seasonal or short-term rentals.

Insight Example:

“Most listings are only available for under 180 days, indicating part-time rentals.”

📍 E. Location Mapping
Use geolocation data (latitude & longitude) to map listings on an interactive map.

Add filters for price, room type, or availability to see geographic patterns.

Insight Example:

“High-priced listings are concentrated in tourist-heavy areas like Downtown and Midtown.”

📈 5. Key Findings & Business Insights
At the end of the project, summarize insights that are useful for:

Area	Insight
Pricing Strategy	Listings with better reviews and location command higher prices
Host Behavior	A few hosts own 50+ listings, suggesting commercial use
Guest Preferences	Most guests prefer private rooms in central locations
Geographic Trends	Tourist areas have the highest concentration of listings
Affordability	Outer neighborhoods offer cheaper options with good availability

📊 6. Optional Additions
You can enhance your project with:

Time Series Analysis (e.g., how listings grew over time)

Review Sentiment Analysis (if review text is available)

Interactive Dashboards using Tableau, Power BI, or Plotly

Machine Learning Model to predict listing price based on features
